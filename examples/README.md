# Examples

The following example notebooks demonstrate important use cases of the _Connectome-Manipulator_ framework:

- <u>Example 1 (basic)</u>: [Null manipulation](./null_manipulation/NullManipulationExample.ipynb)
- <u>Example 2 (basic)</u>: [Remove connections](./remove_connections/)
- <u>Example 3 (basic)</u>: [Rewire connections based on an adjacency matrix](./rewire_adjacency/RewireAdjacencyExample.ipynb)
- <u>Example 4 (advanced)</u>: [Interneuron rewiring in SSCx](https://github.com/BlueBrain/sscx-connectome-manipulations)
- <u>Example 5 (advanced)</u>: [Simplified connectomes in SSCx](https://github.com/BlueBrain/sscx-connectome-manipulations)

- More to come...
