| __[/no_manipulation.py](no_manipulation.py)__ | __No manipulation__ <br> This is just a dummy manipulation function performing no manipulation at all. This function is intended as a control condition to run the manipulation pipeline without actually manipulating the connectome. |  |
| __[/conn_removal.py](conn_removal.py)__ | __Connection removal__ <br> Removes a certain percentage of connections (i.e., all synapses belonging to a connection) between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...), optionally removing only connections within a certain range of #synapses/connection. | ![Connection removal](../../images/conn_removal.png "Connection removal") |
| __[/syn_removal.py](syn_removal.py)__ | __Synapse removal__ <br> Removes a certain percentage of synapses between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...), resulting in (a) reduced #synapses/connection or (b) removed connections (i.e., all synapses of a connection removed). | ![Synapse removal](../../images/syn_removal.png "Synapse removal") |
|                     | Optionally: <br> Keeping connections (i.e., at least 1 synapse/connection kept). | ![Synapse removal, keeping connections](../../images/syn_removal_keepConn.png "Synapse removal, keeping connections") |
|                     | Optionally: <br> Re-scaling conductances G* of remaining synapses to keep sum of conductances per connection constant (unless whole connection is removed). | ![Synapse removal, re-scaling conductances](../../images/syn_removal_scaleG.png "Synapse removal, re-scaling conductances") |
| __[/syn_prop_alteration.py](syn_prop_alteration.py)__ | __Synapse property alteration__ <br> Alters values of certain synapse properties (e.g., conductance, delay, ...) of a certain percentage of synapses between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...) by setting them to a new absolute value, relative scaling, randomizing, ... <br> Example: Afferent section pos/ID set to 0 (= soma) | ![Synapse property alteration](../../images/syn_prop_alter.png "Synapse property alteration") |
| __[/syn_addition.py](syn_addition.py)__ | __Synapse addition__ <br> Adds a certain number of synapses (e.g., total percentage, percentage per connection, ...) to existing connections between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...) by (i) duplicating existing synapses, (ii) deriving from existing synapses (duplicating and randomizing certain properties based on a model) [not yet implemented], or (iii) loading from an external connectome [not yet implemented]. <br> Optionally: Re-scaling gSyns (conductances) to keep sum of gSyns per connection constant. | ![Synapse addition](../../images/syn_add.png "Synapse addition") |
| __[/conn_rewiring.py](conn_rewiring.py)__ | __Connection rewiring__ <br> Rewiring of connections between pairs of neurons based on a given connection probability model, re-using existing synapses (a) preserving #synapses/connections or (b) not preserving #synapses/connections, or (c) adding new synapses, if needed [not yet implemented]. | ![Connection rewiring](../../images/conn_rewire.png "Connection rewiring") |
| | Algorithm: For each post-synaptic target neuron... <br> <br> ![Model-based connection rewiring](../../images/conn_rewire_model.png "Model-based connection rewiring") | |
