# Manipulations overview

| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| __/no_manipulation.py__ | __No manipulation__ <br> This is just a dummy manipulation function performing no manipulation at all. This function is intended as a control condition to run the manipulation pipeline without actually manipulating the connectome. |  |
| __/conn_removal.py__ | __Connection removal__ <br> Removes a certain percentage of connections (i.e., all synapses belonging to a connection) between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...), optionally removing only connections within a certain range of #synapses/connection. | <img src=../../images/conn_removal.png width=800 /> |
| __/syn_removal.py__ | __Synapse removal__ <br> Removes a certain percentage of synapses between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...), resulting in (a) reduced #synapses/connection or (b) removed connections (i.e., all synapses of a connection removed). | <img src=../../images/syn_removal.png width=800 /> |
|                     | Optionally: <br> Keeping connections (i.e., at least 1 synapse/connection kept). | <img src=../../images/syn_removal_keepConn.png width=800 /> |
|                     | Optionally: <br> Re-scaling gSyns (conductances) of remaining synapses to keep sum of gSyns per connection constant (unless whole connection is removed). | <img src=../../images/syn_removal_scaleG.png width=800 /> |
| __/syn_prop_alteration.py__ | __Synapse property alteration__ <br> Alters values of certain synapse properties (e.g., conductance, delay, ...) of a certain percentage of synapses between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...) by setting them to a new absolute value, relative scaling, randomizing, ... <br> Example: Afferent section pos/ID set to 0 (= soma) | <img src=../../images/syn_prop_alter.png width=800 /> |
| __/syn_addition.py__ | __Synapse addition__ <br> Adds a certain number of synapses (e.g., total percentage, percentage per connection, ...) to existing connections between selected groups of neurons (layers, m-types, ...) by (i) duplicating existing synapses, (ii) deriving from existing synapses (duplicating and randomizing certain properties based on a model) [not yet implemented], or (iii) loading from an external connectome [not yet implemented]. <br> Optionally: Re-scaling gSyns (conductances) to keep sum of gSyns per connection constant. | <img src=../../images/syn_add.png width=800 /> |
